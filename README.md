# dotfiles

This is my personal repo for my most important configuration files that I use across most of my devices.

Here are included:

* .profile _(some random stuff)_
* .bashrc _(mostly for the fancy colors)_
* .vimrc _(this is a fork of [this](https://amix.dk/vim/vimrc.html) awesome vimrc)_
* .Xressources _(mostly for urxvt)_
